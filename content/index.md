Hi there :wave:

My name is John Grubb, and this is my blog.  I've been writing here sporadically since February 2009, which means some of these words are 15 years old now.  I started here very deep in the music business and about to start a journey into technology.  Most of the early posts here reflect the beginnings of that journey and serve as a breadcrumb trail of how my brain used to work.

Since the last 8 years or so I've been working for a company call [Platform.sh](https:platform.sh) in a variety of roles, most recently in data and finops and stuff like that.  I just moved into a new site generator and felt the impulse to clean up all these old posts and get this thing living again.
