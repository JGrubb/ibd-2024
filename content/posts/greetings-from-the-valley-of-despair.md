This blog... 

This blog is interesting to myself because like I said in a recent-ish post - it really maps out a 12 year master Dunning Kruger cycle in technology, with baby Dunning Kruger journeys into different topic areas along the way. Early in this blog I had _so much to say_. Later in this blog I am aware of _how much I don't know_. The post frequency maps almost exactly with this chart that I recently took a look at again:
