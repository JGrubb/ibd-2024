Out with the old, in with the newer.  Yes, I just spent the last 3 hours writing SQL queries, mostly by hand in order to move this blog back from Drupal to Wordpress where it belongs.  Some of the effects are still evident, such as the weird catagories.  Luckily I find this kind of shit fun now, so I'll fix it tomorrow.  Thanks for stopping by.
