I don't know, this just came to me. For several months now I've been trying to make some changes to old behaviors. One of them is a lack of communicating, of building up a thing or a plan in my head without talking it over with the people whom it affects.

I've summarized this as something like 

> When I have a good idea - when I see the path - I assume everyone sees it too.

So I've been making more of an effort to communicate everything in the last few months, whether it's the Big Idea that I have at work or the difficult conversation that I don't want to have with this coworker. 

It just popped in my head a second ago that part of the reason that people don't see The Path is that it's not their path. They have their own paths they're moving down. It's my job to explain _my_ path to them as soon and as often as possible, especially if I need their help getting down it.
