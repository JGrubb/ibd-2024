> Just because I'm losing
> Doesn't mean I'm lost

I don't know really how to get into this one, but I was talking with someone earlier today about The Struggle. The Struggle is all I've been working against for the last 10 years since I started this blog. I don't want to say that The Struggle is over, but if it's the mountain I've been climbing I think I'm basically at the top of it now. I need to find another mountain to climb now.

I started this blog a lifetime ago, and I feel like an almost completely different person than I was back then but I've been working on the same thing this whole time - feed my family and find a gig that makes me feel empowered to do what I'm good at and that gives me room to grow.

So now I'm here, my family is fed and I have a job with some upside and some growing responsibility. It's a fun job, I like my coworkers, and there's growth there if I can figure out how to [continue to] grow it.

That's the trick now. Now that the daily/weekly/yearly job of grinding it out against The Struggle has gotten me to where I was trying to be that whole time, I have to refocus on something larger.
