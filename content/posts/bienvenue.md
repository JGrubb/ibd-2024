## Problemspace

I haven't posted anything in over a year. I'm almost rusted shut, yet I lately feel the need to commit to creating a new row in the database that backs this blog.

## Solutionspace

Just start writing.

I've been at this gig for over 3 years now, and I've learned a decent deal about the "real world", the one that I wanted to exist in toward the end of my last career. I scored that tech job, I got bumped up to mgmt about 8 months ago. I actually really enjoy it and I'd kind of like to journal some of the things I've learned along the way here.

Anyway, if you knew me in my 20s and you're reading this - thank you. I'm going to just start writing.
