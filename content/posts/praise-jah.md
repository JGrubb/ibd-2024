My first post on my new blog! I wrote this one all by myself, with the help of hundreds and hundreds of open source collaborators, Stack Overflow commenters, IRC, Google Groups, and sheer force of WILL!!!

This is my first running, production Ruby on Rails app. It took me about two days/6 hours to write, and about 4 days/30 hours to deploy. Deploy means "make work on the web so people can see it" and it was every bit the pain in the ass that I'd heard it was supposed to be. But by god, here it is! Nginx/Passenger/MySql/Rails. I'll make it look prettier later, and hopefully also have something to say.

Guess I also need to set it to something other than Greenwich mean time. It begins! Some more!
