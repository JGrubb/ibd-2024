...that the DOJ approved the merger of everyone's two favorite companies in the touring business - TicketMaster and LiveNation? They found no reason to have anti-trust concerns with a merger between a monopolistic ticket service and a monopolistic concert promoter/venue owner. But wait! There's more!


One person who may have had some input into this decision was FCC chairman Julius Genachowski. Fun fact about Mr. Genachowski - one of his previous gigs before he came to Washington was [on the board of directors at - wait for it - TicketMaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Genachowski)! I'm sure there was no conflict of interest if he did in fact have a say in this decision.


I'm sure we've all heard of Obama's hard-ass chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. Fun fact about Mr. Emanuel - his brother, Ari, is a hard-ass Hollywood talent agent. He was supposedly the inspiration behind the character Ari on the HBO show Entourage. I'm sure that [his being on the board of directors at LiveNation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Emanuel) played no part in swaying the DOJ's decision to let this absurdly anti-competitive, big-business friendly decision to go through.


I might as well have voted for Palin...
