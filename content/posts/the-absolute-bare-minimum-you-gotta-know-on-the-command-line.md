GUIs change, but the command line is eternal. Memorize these 5 commands and a long and happy life awaits.

~~~

$cd
change directory. This is how you move 
around the file system.

$ls
List, or tell me what's in this directory. This has a 
huge list of useful modifying flags, such as -l (long, 
tell me the size, ownership, and permissions on each 
thing in here too), or -a (all, as in, show me hidden 
dotfiles as well)

$mv
Move, this is how you move something from here 
to there. This is also how you rename something 
even if it's in the right place.

$cp
Copy. Add -r to make it recursive, else it 
won't copy directories because it won't 
descend into them.

$pwd
present working directory. this 
is how you get it to tell you where you are 
in the file system.
