Hey Dennis, I became a first time WNCW member during the Gospel Truth a few weeks ago. It really is a different feeling you get listening to a radio station that you're helping to support, but that's not my point...

I moved up to New Jersey for the Railroad Earth gig a very long time ago now, but I'm an App State alumni, class of 2001. I've been trying to get back down to somewhere in the WNCW listening area ever since but despite my best efforts, me and my family have gone and grown roots up here. I don't know if I'll ever make it back down there, and that makes me sad.

But lately, I've been listening to Goin Across the Mt every weekend on some NPR app on my phone and hearing your voice makes me a little less sad, so thank you.
