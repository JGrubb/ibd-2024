"When U2 takes the stage in Los Angeles' Rose Bowl Stadium this Sunday, fans in the United States and 15 other countries will be able to watch the whole show, live and for free, on YouTube â€” the first time the website has ever broadcast a complete concert live."


Are you kidding me? This is the first time that YouTube has broadcast a concert live? Did I somehow get teleported back to 2006? I would think that news of this nature would seem a lot more like news back then, but seriously?

The first time *ever*?

Maybe I'm not as late to the party as I thought with all this, y'know, technology stuff. I guess giant-mega-corp will always move this slowly. Is it already time to add Google to the Dinosaur List?
