I've known about the Dunning-Kruger effect for years, thanks to Hacker News and its penchant for surfacing the names of Things. It never occurred to me before just now that my steady decline in productivity here on this blog, or rather the extreme productivity I enjoyed in posting to this blog in its first year, were the result of the Dunning-Kruger effect. I had so much to say! I had no idea what I was talking about!

It's a damn shame, because it really did help me to let that stuff out of my head, as I'm sure it would help me now. It's just that now that I know so, so much more about the technology business I'm so much more acutely aware of all that I don't know about the technology business.

I'ma try and get over that though, because just letting the thoughts out of my head is a very soothing process, and I have no illusions that anyone is actually reading this thing anymore. Ciao.
