"Microsoft's core problem is that they have lost the hearts of computer enthusiasts."

- the Daring Fireball in a piece called [Microsoft's long, slow decline](http://daringfireball.net/2009/07/microsofts_long_slow_decline). He sums up my feelings almost perfectly. I apologize ahead of time for being a snobby Mac asshole, but feel my decades of loyalty to MS-DOS and Windows justify and inform my opinions sufficiently.
