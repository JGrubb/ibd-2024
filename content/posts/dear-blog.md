I've been so busy lately that I forgot to wish you a happy birthday yesterday. I'm sorry. I thought today was yesterday, and I really have been looking forward to this day, er yesterday, for a while now. 

We've both been through a hell of a lot in the last five years, I seriously can't believe it's been that long. You were born in the RRE tour bus between Stroudsburg and Easton on our way to play the GA Theater (the old one!). You only stayed in Blogger for all of a week before I whisked you away into Wordpress. I've moved you a lot, and you've helped me keep a handle on where I've been over this vastly more difficult and private and rewarding section of my life. Thanks for sticking with me.
