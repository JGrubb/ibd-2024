I didn't remember mixing this but it must've been some time last year. This was the gig that Vince Herman opened up and Phil Lesh pulled up in his Ferrari out front and helped us level the joint for the second set. Strangely, there were no tapers present whatsoever, so no tapes showed up on the Archive. This was, however, one of the tours that we were taping for [Elko](http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/sites/default/files/2005-04-16_San_Francisco_CA.zip), so we were running a 24 track rig that evening. I remember it being a challenge to get everyone down to 24 inputs, and being really glad that we figured it out later.

I remember listening to the little slice that we did put up on the Archive while I was doing this and being amazed how much reverb I put on it. Here's a drier version of the whole show.
