Enlightenment is realizing that the straight job with the commute and the boss actually provides more of what you were seeking from the experience of being a professional grade musician than being in a professional grade band.

For the first time ever I'm part of a team with stated goals and long term plans laid out in service of attaining those goals. It's an amazing feeling that I wouldn't have had I not given the band thing the commitment that I did.

So thank you, Railroad Earth, for letting me have the experience that gives me the perspective that I have now.

And thank you, ABM teammates. Looking forward to it.
