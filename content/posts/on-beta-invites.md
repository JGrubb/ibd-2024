This is currently in regards to the Atom editor that I dutifully filled out an "invite" request for. It could be about anything, though. I get this same feeling every time.

It takes me right back to high school gym class and waiting to get picked for a team. And waiting. And waiting. And God this is embarrassing, will somebody please fucking pick me already?

This is a piece of software that you install on your computer. Not a Saas thing that'll buckle under the weight of too many users. I thought Mailbox actually did a pretty cool thing by providing that countdown that gave you all the visibility you really needed into the process, and removed that feeling from the waiting. 

And waiting. 

And waiting.
