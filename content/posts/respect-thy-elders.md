I'm starting a new gig in a couple weeks. I found out about the existence of the gig in the first place because I follow the guy who will be my new boss on Twitter, since he's been around the Drupal scene and very long time and following the leaders in your industry is basically one of the core things that Twitter is \*for\*.

You don't need to necessarily know every single leader in every single lang, but if you work on the web and want to move your career forward, you'd do well to know who most of these people are, in absolutely no order. This is absolutely (and hopefully obviously) not an exhaustive list, more of a starter pack. 

- Dries Buytaert
- Taylor Otwell
- Fabien Potencier
- Guido van Rossum
- Jacob Kaplan-Moss
- Kenneth Reitz
- Matz
- David Heinemeier Hansson
- Rich Hickey
- Brendan Eich

If you're a Drupal dev, you should add these to the list

- Larry Garfield
- Robert Douglass
- Peter Wolanin
- Angie Byron
- Jeff Eaton

Getting to know not just the tools out there but the folks who made them and their reasons for making them can really help you decide if a given tool was created for a use case like yours.
