That unwanted thing that Google put in your top menu bar? That bothers you, too? Can't find where to turn it off? That's because they wanted to hide it from you.

1. `chrome://flags` - put that in your address bar.
2. Search for 'notifi', as in 'notifications' (which is what it's called right now).
3. DISABLE
