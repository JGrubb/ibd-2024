[Communities of Creators](http://feeds.dashes.com/~r/AnilDash/~3/dGG_dHl0_MI/communities-of-creators.html): "What I've found, though, is that being part of an active, ambitious, supportive and diverse community of peers is just as valuable, if not more so, than any of the more prosaic prerequisites for success."

I'll bet that's true. Maybe I'll find out someday.
