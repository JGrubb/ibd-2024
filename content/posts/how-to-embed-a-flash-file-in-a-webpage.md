This is actually two different commands. One is for Mozilla browsers and the other is for everyone else. I forget why, something about the object property not being recognized by Mozilla. Maybe it's the other way around. If you're curious, it's out there.


You'll want to adjust the FILENAME and the width and height properties in two places - inside the object and inside the embed. Enjoy.
