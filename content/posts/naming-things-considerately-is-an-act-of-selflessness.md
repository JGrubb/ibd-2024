Not sure if I mentioned this in the last post, but what I'm doing right now is essentially building a data warehouse for the company. It's from scratch, there was nothing here beforehand, so I get get to/have had to chose everything from the tech stack to the processes to my favorite part of late: naming things.

The name you give to a piece of software, or a command line flag, or a column in a database is an act of asynchronous communication with another human. You are asking them to care about the thing you've built. If they chose to work with your tool, you are asking them to understand the choices that you made in its design. 

The most selfless thing you can do is think about how much effort it takes for the user who did not design the thing to understand how to use the thing. Name things according to what they are and what they do, make it intuitive. This is what design is. It's not the parts that most people will never see, it's the parts that most people will only see.
