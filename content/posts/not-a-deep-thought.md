I was listening to Taylor Swift yesterday - [Everything Has Changed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMcMbWl0fDk) from her new version of the album. There's this bit in the bridge at about 2:30 where the backgrounds do this "haaaa, ahhhh, ahhhh" thing that's so wonderfully out of tune and everybody involved in the making of this album had the courage to _leave it_.

Nobody does that anymore. I started thinking about how auto-tune has really enabled the elimination of musical talent as a condition for creating music, and made it that much easier to just create pure product with no musical value at all.

Get off my lawn.
